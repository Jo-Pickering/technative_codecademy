          As well as HTML elements (e.g. <span class="html">p</span>,
          <span class="html">h1</span>, etc) you can use various selectors to
          style your HTML. You should always style by broadest specificity
          first, to allow for more granular styles as you go down (e.g. by
          element first, then class, with id used very sparingly as it’s single
          instance).
        </p>

          chain them below!

        <p>
          The table below shows the different ways of selecting HTMl to style.
          They are listed from most general to most specific.
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <th scope="col">
              <tr>
                <td class="header">Selector</td>
                <td class="header">Role</td>
                <td class="header">Explanation</td>
              </tr>
            </th>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><span class="css">*</span></td>
              <td>Universal selector</td>
              <td>
                Targets all HTML elements (or can be set to target children of a
                specific parent).
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><span class="css">.class</span></td>
              <td>Selects a HTML class to style.</td>
              <td>
                This can help distinguish between different instances of
                elements (e.g. <span class="html">< p class = ”brand”></span> vs
                <span class="html">< p class="general”></span>). Class selectors
                override element selectors. CSS <span class="css">.class</span>
                values can be written separately but can be combined in HTML
                (see HTML class cribsheet) to apply both styles.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><span class="html">[attribute]</span></td>
              <td>
                selects all elements with a specific attribute (e.g. href)
              </td>
              <td>
                It could style all links without need for a new class instance.
                <br />You can also separate out types of attributes depending on
                their value using element<span class="html"
                  >[attribute*=value]</span
                >
                (e.g. <span class="css">img[src*=’winter’]{}</span> would only
                format images with winter in their source links.)
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>#id</td>
              <td>to style a unique block of HTML.</td>
              <td>
                Cannot have stacked values in HTML as it is unique, so all
                corresponding style code needs to be in the CSS declaration
                block and won’t be reused elsewhere on the page. Can be used in
                combination with a class for both sets of properties but will
                override element and class selectors.

        <p>
          It is possible to combine selectors in order to add specificity when
          style elements are valid for mutliple parts of HTML.
