                  Rather than generating the code myself, this has been an
                  interestign exercise in debugging someone else's work. I've
                  managed to get the desktop site looking decent, but mobile has
                  much to be desired. In hindsight, I wish I'd done mobile
                  first! Click the name to view the project.

                  I'd never seen JavaScript before this week and this was a
                  couple of the bigger end of module projects on Codecademy. Its
                  not the best code, but I think its useful to demostrate my
                  progress over the weeks. Click the name to view the project.

                  This was a project set by TechNative that was part follow the
                  instructions and part freer practice. I really enjoyed setting
                  to see JS in practice on the web and it helped inspire some
                  features on this site. Click the name to view the project.

                  This was a very quick additional project with Chloe, Elyas and
                  Helder to practice using Git and GitHub. It's based on the
                  Codecademy 'Mixed Messages' project. It was the first time
                  we'd made branches, pull requests and merged work! Click the

                  This was our first group project, set by TechNative and the
                  attached employers. We had a design brief to work from but
                  were free to create a site on whatever we wanted. It was a
                  tough 4 days, but I'm really proud of what we've put together.
